# Medicinal-Plant-Management-Application
This application enables efficient management of medicinal plant inventory, providing functionalities such as adding, updating, and removing plants, as well as recording sales. Users can view the available plants, sort them by registration date, and save all changes to a file for persistence.
Key Features:
âœ” Add Plants â€“ Plants are registered with a name, quantity, price, and registration date.
âœ” Stock Update â€“ Users can modify a plant's quantity or have it automatically removed when stock reaches zero.
âœ” Sort by Date â€“ Plants can be sorted in ascending or descending order based on the registration date.
âœ” Data Persistence â€“ All information is stored in a file to remain accessible after restarting the application.
âœ” Sales Logging â€“ A sales history is maintained to track sold products.

This application is useful for herbal pharmacies, medicinal plant producers, or anyone looking to efficiently manage their stock of natural products. ðŸš€ðŸŒ¿

In this project, I utilized a variety of skills, including:
1. Java Programming
Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, constructors, and method overloading.
Working with classes, objects, and methods.

2. File Handling
Reading from and writing to text files using BufferedReader and BufferedWriter.
Managing persistent data storage for available and sold plants.

3. Data Structures & Algorithms
Using lists (ArrayList) to store and manage plants.
Implementing sorting algorithms (sorting by name, price, quantity, and registration date).

4. Exception Handling
Using try-catch blocks to handle errors in file operations and data parsing.
Throwing and catching IllegalArgumentException for validation.

5. GUI Development with Swing
Creating a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing.
Designing JFrame, JPanel, JTable, JTextField, JButton, and handling user interactions with ActionListener.

6. Date and Time Handling
Using LocalDate to store and manage the registration date of plants.
Parsing and formatting dates correctly in the repository.

7. Authentication System
Implementing a login system (LoginGUI) to restrict access to the main application.

8. Debugging and Problem Solving
Identifying and fixing issues such as method errors, incorrect data parsing, and sorting logic.
Improving functionality, like removing plants with zero quantity from the list.

This project demonstrates my ability to build a Java-based inventory management system with a GUI, file persistence, and sorting features.
